  /*
explanation1:
 req.body contains the data sent by the client in the body of the HTTP request. This data is typically sent from a form on the frontend (e.g., a signup or login form) and is captured on the server using middleware like express.json().

explanation2:
The line { user, token } = await registerUser(username, email, password); is a key part of the signup process that takes place in the signup controller function within the authController.ts. Hereâ€™s an explanation of what is happening step-by-step:

Explanation of the Line:
Calling the registerUser Function:

registerUser(username, email, password) is a call to a service function defined in authService.ts.
This function is responsible for creating a new user, saving them to the database, and generating a token for authentication.
await Keyword:

The await keyword is used because registerUser is an asynchronous function, meaning it returns a promise.
await pauses the execution of the signup function until the promise is resolved, ensuring that the user and token values are available for further use.
Destructuring the Response:

The response from registerUser is destructured into two variables: { user, token }.
This means the function registerUser returns an object containing a user object and a token string, and these are being unpacked directly.
